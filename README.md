## TODO

- Write report
  - Purpose of project
  - Information about data (see data_generation.ipynb)
    - How data was collected (what sets used)
      - Image criteria
    - How organized (ratio of pos to neg)
  - Process for increasing data size via augumentation
  - Transfer learning
    - What models did we use?
  - Results
  - Further work
    - Check whether image has people in it
- Create functions/scripts for
  - pre-processing data
- Create notebooks for
  - transfer learning (each model)
