# cs665-final

A repository of code and image data for our CS 665 Deep Learning final project.

## TODO

- Write this README
  - Purpose of project
  - Information about data
    - How data was collected (what sets used)
      - Image criteria
    - How organized (ratio of pos to neg)
    - Social dist = pos, not social dist = neg
  - Process for increasing data size via augumentation
  - Transfer learning
    - What models did we use?
  - Results
  - Further work
    - Check whether image has people in it
- Copy and clean image data for positives
- Clean up template with similar information to README
- Create notebooks for
  - augumenting data
  - transfer learning (each model)
- Share this file
- Share word doc
